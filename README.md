# Homomorphic Encryption Playground

This is my WWDC 2021 Swift Student Challenge project about Homomorphic Encryption! (Accepted)

With this playground I would like to introduce the possibilities and the functionality of Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption. In doing so, I will try to simplify the commonly used mathematical notations to explanatory texts and figures. In my Playground, I implemented the Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption scheme by Junfeng Fan and Frederik Vercauteren.

I hope that this will give an easy access to the topic of homomorphic encryption.
