# Homomorphic Encryption Playground

This is my WWDC 2021 Swift Student Challenge project about Homomorphic Encryption! (Accepted)

With this playground I would like to introduce the possibilities and the functionality of the homomorphic encoding. In doing so, I will try to simplify the commonly used mathematical notations to explanatory texts and figures.
I hope that this will give an easy access to the topic of homomorphic encryption.

## Usage

* Unzip the <code>HomomorphicEncryption.playground.zip</code> file
* Open the unzipped file in Swift Playgrounds (preferably iPadOS)
